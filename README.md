OliBranchApp
OliBranchApp is a full-stack fintech application designed to provide users with personalized financial insights, product recommendations, and a community chat feature. This project uses React Native for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, MongoDB for the database, and integrates a Python-based AI/ML model for financial recommendations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
MongoDB (either locally installed or via MongoDB Atlas).
Python installed (for the AI/ML model).
Expo CLI or React Native setup for mobile app development.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OliBranchApp.git
cd OliBranchApp
Install dependencies for the front-end:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Install dependencies for the back-end:

bash
Copy code
cd ../server
npm install
Set up environment variables (in .env files):

Create a .env file in the server/ folder with the following variables:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/olibranch
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Set up MongoDB:

Start your MongoDB service locally or create a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
Make sure your MongoDB URI is correctly set in the .env file.
Set up AI/ML model:

Navigate to the server/ml/ folder.
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model using recommendation_model.py (details in the AI/ML section).
Running the Application
Running the Front-End
Start the front-end (React Native):

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
This will launch Expo, and you can run the app on your mobile device or emulator.

Running the Back-End
Start the back-end (Express API):

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
The back-end server will run at http://localhost:3000.

Running Both (Development Mode)
To run both the front-end and back-end concurrently, you can use concurrently:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
API Endpoints
User Routes
Method   Endpoint Description
GET   /api/user   Fetch user profile and recommendations.
POST  /api/user   Create a new user.
PUT   /api/user/:id  Update user details.
Authentication Routes
Method   Endpoint Description
POST  /api/auth/login   Log in and receive JWT.
POST  /api/auth/register   Register a new user.
AI/ML Model
The AI/ML model is a Python-based recommendation engine that suggests financial products based on the user's financial data.

Running the AI/ML Model
Navigate to the server/ml/ directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server/ml
Ensure all Python dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
To train the model:

bash
Copy code
python recommendation_model.py
The trained model will be used to generate financial product recommendations based on a user's financial profile.

Environment Variables
Variable Description
MONGO_URI   MongoDB connection string
JWT_SECRET  Secret key for JWT authentication
API_BASE_URL   URL for external financial data API
Deployment
Back-End (Express + MongoDB)
You can deploy the back-end using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Make sure to set environment variables on your deployment platform.
Front-End (React Native)
For production builds, you can use Expo to publish the app or build standalone binaries (APK, IPA).
The app can be published on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
Continuous Integration (CI)
Set up GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment.
You can use tools like Travis CI or CircleCI to automate the build process for both the front-end and back-end.
Contributing
